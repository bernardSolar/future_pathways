# Understanding Future Pathways: A Visual Analysis of Civilization Trajectories

## Introduction
The Future Pathways visualization presents a three-dimensional analysis of possible trajectories for human civilization, focusing on the interrelationships between economic growth, environmental impact, and resource consumption. This document explains the key components of the visualization and the different pathways it represents.

## The Three Axes

### X-Axis: CO2e Emissions (GT/yr)
This axis represents annual greenhouse gas emissions in gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent. It ranges from negative values (-20 GT/yr) on the left, representing net carbon removal from the atmosphere, to positive values (60 GT/yr) on the right, indicating net emissions. Our current position is approximately 50 GT/yr.

### Y-Axis: Growth (%/yr)
This vertical axis represents annual economic growth, measured as a percentage change in GDP/energy use/civilization complexity. It ranges from -5% (significant decline) to +5% (rapid growth). Our current position shows approximately 2.5% growth, typical of modern industrial economies.

### Z-Axis: Material Use (GT/yr)
This axis represents annual material consumption, including all extracted resources, from minerals to biomass. Current global material consumption is approximately 106 billion tonnes annually, with projections suggesting potential increases to 160 billion tonnes by 2060 under business-as-usual scenarios.

## Some Example Pathways

### 0. Historical Trajectory (From first COP in 1995 to 2024)
- The steep upward trend in both emissions and material use from 1995 to 2024
- The COVID-19 dip in growth around 2020, showing as a dramatic downward spike
- The rapid recovery and return to high emissions/material use by 2024
- How we've consistently remained in or above the "Energy Transition Zone" in terms of growth, 
but have been moving away from sustainable emissions and material use levels

### 1. Business As Usual (BAU)
This pathway represents the continuation of current trends:
- Increasing CO2e emissions reaching 60 GT/yr
- Declining growth rates due to environmental and resource constraints
- Continued increase in material consumption
- Eventually leads to negative growth as systems become stressed
- Represents the default trajectory without significant intervention

### 2. Degrowth (Hickel)
Based on Jason Hickel's vision of planned economic contraction:
- Rapid reduction in CO2e emissions through planned economic transformation
- Controlled descent to zero growth (steady state economy)
- Significant reduction in material consumption
- Maintains basic services while reducing environmental impact
- Emphasizes redistribution and wellbeing over GDP growth

### 3. The Great Simplification (Hagens)
Based on Nate Hagens's analysis of energy and resource constraints:
- Gradual then accelerating decline in emissions as energy constraints bind
- Increasingly negative growth as complexity reduces
- Forced reduction in material consumption
- Represents an adaptive descent driven by physical limits
- More severe than degrowth but more orderly than collapse

### 4. Eco-modernist Utopia
Represents the techno-optimist vision:
- Rapid transition to negative emissions through technological innovation
- Maintained or increasing growth through efficiency and innovation
- Initial increase then decline in material use through advanced recycling
- Assumes successful decoupling of growth from environmental impact
- Relies heavily on technological advancement

### 5. Way et al. Fast Transition
https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(22)00410-X

Based on empirically-grounded technology forecasts for rapid decarbonization:

- Exponential decrease in CO2e emissions reaching near-zero by 2050, with potential for negative emissions
- Maintains positive economic growth through cost savings and new infrastructure development
- Initial high material use for renewable infrastructure buildout, followed by efficiency gains
- Leverages current deployment rates of solar, wind, batteries and electrolyzers
- Shows rapid transition can be cheaper than business as usual

### 6. Way et al. Slow Transition
https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(22)00410-X

Represents a more gradual approach to energy system transformation:

- Slower exponential decrease in emissions as fossil fuels phased out gradually
- Lower but still positive growth due to higher transition costs and delayed benefits
- Sustained high material use from maintaining parallel energy systems
- Fossil fuels continue to dominate until mid-century
- Demonstrates higher costs of delayed action

### 7. Way et al. No Transition
https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(22)00410-X

Models continued fossil fuel dependence without significant system change:

- Rising CO2e emissions from continued fossil fuel use
- Declining economic growth from mounting climate impacts and higher costs
- Increasing material use from fossil infrastructure maintenance and climate adaptation
- Similar to BAU but with more explicit modeling of economic consequences
- Based on empirical costs of maintaining fossil fuel systems

## Time Dimension
Each point along a pathway represents a potential future state, with markers indicating years from 2024 to 2060. This allows us to visualize not just the direction but also the speed of changes in each scenario.

## Key Insights

### Interconnections
The visualization reveals how changes in one dimension affect others. For example:
- BAU shows how continued emissions eventually impact growth negatively
- Degrowth demonstrates planned reductions across all dimensions
- Great Simplification shows forced reductions due to system constraints
- Eco-modernist path suggests potential technology-enabled decoupling

### Trade-offs
Different pathways represent different societal choices and their consequences:
- Between maintaining growth and reducing environmental impact
- Between planned versus forced adaptation
- Between technological and social solutions

### Timing
The temporal dimension reveals:
- The urgency of decisions about future directions
- The different speeds of transition in each scenario
- Critical periods where changes become more dramatic
- The increasing divergence of outcomes over time

## Summary
This three-dimensional representation helps us understand the complex relationships between economic activity, environmental impact, and resource use. It illustrates how different philosophical and practical approaches to our civilization's challenges might play out over time, and the trade-offs involved in each pathway.

The visualization serves as a tool for understanding the scope of change required for sustainability, the potential consequences of inaction, and the different visions for navigating our civilizational challenges. It can inform discussions about policy choices, technological development, and societal adaptation strategies.
