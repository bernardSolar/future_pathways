### Other Relationships to Visualize
In the visualization we have been plotting Growth and CO2 emissions against Material use.
From Nate Hagens's work, there are other quantities that we could plot against instead of Materials.

Here are some key alternatives that Hagens frequently discusses:

1. Energy Systems:
- Energy Return on Investment (EROI)
- Net energy available to society
- Oil reserves quality (not just quantity)
- Total primary energy supply
- Energy per capita

2. Financial/Monetary:
- Total global debt
- Money supply (M2)
- Derivatives exposure
- Real vs financial economy ratio
- Monetary velocity

3. Social/Complexity Metrics:
- Societal complexity (could be measured via energy use per transaction)
- Social capital/trust measures
- Infrastructure maintenance requirements
- Supply chain complexity
- Information processing requirements

4. Ecological/Resource:
- Topsoil depletion
- Groundwater depletion
- Biodiversity indices
- Phosphorus reserves
- Critical mineral availability

5. System Risk Metrics:
- Financial system leverage
- System interdependence
- Redundancy levels
- Supply chain length
- System bottlenecks

Hagens particularly emphasizes the relationship between:
1. Energy and financial systems
2. Complexity and resource requirements
3. Social trust and system functioning

### Focus on the most crucial relationships that underpin The Great Simplification

According to Hagens's work, the most crucial relationships that underpin The Great Simplification are:

1. **Energy-Economy Nexus**
- Energy Return on Investment (EROI) vs Economic Growth
- This is perhaps his most emphasized relationship
- Shows how declining EROI leads to economic contraction
- Demonstrates why "green growth" might be physically constrained
- Links directly to financial system stability

2. **Monetary-Energy Relationship**
- Debt/Money Creation vs Energy Availability
- Shows how our financial system requires growth
- Demonstrates why debt cannot infinitely expand without energy growth
- Explains potential financial system instability during energy descent

3. **Complexity-Energy Coupling**
- Societal Complexity vs Energy Use
- Shows how our complex systems require high energy input
- Demonstrates why simplification might be inevitable
- Explains why maintaining current complexity becomes harder

We could create a new visualization using any of these three key relationships. The most data-rich and quantifiable might be the Energy-Economy nexus, where we could plot:
- X-axis: EROI (declining from left to right)
- Y-axis: Economic Growth Rate
- Z-axis: Energy Use per Capita

This would show how:
- BAU pathway hits EROI constraints
- Eco-modernist pathway assumes EROI problems can be solved
- Degrowth pathway attempts to manage the descent
- Great Simplification pathway follows the physics of energy descent

### Dashboard App

Considering the number of possible relationships, migrating to an online dashboard might be a good idea.
Using the dashboard, users can choose which relationships to plot against each other, depending on what relationships interest them the most.
