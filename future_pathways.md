# Visualizing Our Future: A 3D Model of Society's Possible Transition Pathways

As society grapples with the challenges of climate change, resource constraints, and economic 
development, one of the most pressing questions we face is: What futures are actually possible? 
This visualization model offers a framework for exploring this question by mapping 
potential transition pathways through the complex interplay of three critical variables: 
economic growth, CO2 emissions, and material use.

## The Model: A Lens for Viewing Possible Futures

The model creates a three-dimensional space where each axis represents a fundamental aspect of our 
civilization's trajectory:
- Economic Growth (measured in percent per year) - AKA "Progress", "Civilisation Complexity", "GDP"
- CO2 Emissions (gigatons per year)
- Material Use (gigatons per year)

Within this space, different "zones" represent possible states of civilization:

- The Energy Transition Zone (2.5-5% growth): Represents successful transition pathways where emissions decrease while maintaining or improving economic growth
- The Intermediate Zone (0-2.5% growth): Represents moderate transition scenarios
- The Descent Zone (negative growth): Represents scenarios involving economic contraction
- The Future Materials Use Zone: Represents pathways involving increased material consumption

Our current position in 2024 sits at approximately 2.5% growth, 50 gigatons of CO2 emissions per 
year, and 106 gigatons of material use per year. From this starting point, the model plots 
several possible futures.

## Past Reality and Competing Visions of the Future

The model maps several distinct transition pathways, one showing our actual trajectory from 1995 to 
2024 while the others represent different philosophical and practical approaches to navigating our future:

### From 1995 to 2024
Since the first Conference of the Parties (COP1) climate conference in 1995 to the present day we 
have seen ever-increasing CO2e emissions and material use, while growth saw a significant reduction 
during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Business as Usual (BAU)
This pathway shows the consequences of maintaining current trends: increasing emissions, growing 
material use, but gradually declining economic growth. The BAU trajectory suggests this approach 
may be fundamentally unsustainable.

### Degrowth (Hickel)
Based on Jason Hickel's work, this pathway envisions a managed reduction in resource consumption 
by wealthy nations while enabling development in poorer regions. The goal is to reach a steady 
state with zero growth, low emissions, and circular material use.

### Great Simplification (Hagens)
Nate Hagens' concept of "measured decline" suggests a managed descent to lower resource use and 
emissions levels, acknowledging potential limitations in our ability to maintain current 
consumption patterns.

### Eco-modernist Utopia
This pathway represents an optimistic vision where technological innovation enables simultaneous 
reduction in emissions and material use while maintaining economic growth.

### Way et al. Transitions
The model includes three variations of transition pathways (Fast, Slow, and No Transition), 
helping visualize how the speed of change affects our trajectory through this three-dimensional 
space.

## Historical Trajectory: Learning from Three Decades of Data

The model's historical trajectory from 1995 to 2024 tells a sobering story about our progress since 
the first Conference of the Parties (COP1) climate conference. By plotting actual data points for 
global emissions, growth, and material use, we can trace humanity's path through this three-dimensional 
possibility space:

### 1995-2010: The Era of Unconstrained Growth
During this period, we see a steady climb across all three dimensions:
- CO2 emissions rose from 23.0 to 33.5 gigatons per year
- Material use increased from 45.0 to 78.0 gigatons per year
- Economic growth remained robust, averaging around 3-4% annually

This trajectory shows how economic growth was achieved through increasing material consumption and 
rising emissions, with little evidence of decoupling between these factors.

### 2010-2019: Acceleration Despite Awareness
Despite growing climate awareness and multiple COPs, this period showed:
- Continued acceleration of emissions from 33.5 to around 40 gigatons
- Material use growth from 78.0 to over 95 gigatons
- Maintained economic growth around 2.5-3%

The path during this period suggests that international climate agreements had little effect on the 
fundamental relationship between growth, materials, and emissions.

### 2020: The COVID-19 Disruption
The pandemic created a dramatic but temporary deviation:
- A sharp drop in emissions
- Negative economic growth (-3.3%)
- Slight decrease in material use

This unexpected experiment demonstrated that rapid emissions reductions are possible, but also 
highlighted the tight coupling between emissions and economic activity under our current system.

### 2020-2024: The Rebound
The post-pandemic period has shown:
- Quick return to pre-pandemic emission levels, reaching 50 gigatons
- Recovery of economic growth to 2.5%
- Material use reaching new highs at 106 gigatons

This "return to normal" suggests that without structural changes, even major disruptions lead only 
to temporary deviations from the established trajectory.

### Implications for Future Pathways

The historical trajectory provides several crucial insights:

1. **Persistent Coupling**: Despite technological advances and policy initiatives, we have not achieved significant decoupling of economic growth from emissions and material use.

2. **Accelerating Trends**: Rather than showing progress toward sustainability, our historical path shows acceleration in both emissions and material use.

3. **Zone Migration**: We have moved steadily away from the sustainable zones defined in the model, making future transitions increasingly challenging.

4. **Policy Effectiveness**: The minimal impact of three decades of climate negotiations on our actual trajectory suggests the need for more fundamental changes in approach.

5. **Transition Urgency**: The growing gap between our current position and sustainable zones highlights the increasing difficulty of achieving a successful energy transition without dramatic changes in direction.

## The Model as a Discussion Tool

Perhaps the most valuable aspect of this visualization is not its predictive power but its ability to facilitate meaningful discussions about our future options. By mapping different proposals in three-dimensional space, it helps us:

1. Visualize Trade-offs: The model makes explicit the relationships between growth, emissions, and material use, helping us understand what we might need to sacrifice to achieve specific goals.

2. Challenge Assumptions: By plotting different pathways, we can question whether certain combinations (like high growth with low emissions and material use) are realistically achievable.

3. Frame Debates: The model provides a common framework for discussing different approaches to transition, helping clarify where various proposals differ and where they might complement each other.

## Limitations and Future Development

While powerful as a thinking and monitoring tool, the model should be understood as a framework for discussion and tracking rather than a precise prediction of future possibilities. Its value lies in helping us visualize, debate, and monitor different transition pathways, not in definitively stating which paths are viable or optimal.

The zones and pathways represented are necessarily simplified versions of complex proposals, and users are encouraged to critique and refine these representations based on their understanding of the underlying concepts. Similarly, when tracking real-world trajectories, it's important to consider factors that might not be captured in the three primary variables.

## Conclusion

As we navigate the challenges of climate change and resource constraints, tools that help us visualize and discuss possible futures become increasingly valuable. This 3D model offers a unique framework for understanding the relationships between key variables in our civilization's trajectory and the various proposals for managing transition.

By making explicit the trade-offs and relationships between growth, emissions, and material use, while also showing our actual historical trajectory, the model helps us move beyond simplified debates and toward a more nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities ahead. Whether we ultimately follow a path of managed descent, ambitious technological transformation, or something in between, understanding the full range of possibilities - and our current direction - is crucial for making informed decisions about our collective future.
